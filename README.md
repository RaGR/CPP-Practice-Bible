# 🧠 C++ Projects Collection

Welcome to my **C++ Projects Repository** — a collection of programs written in my beloved language, **C++ ❤️**.  
These projects explore fundamental programming principles and classic algorithmic problems, built the traditional way: with clean logic, structure, and clarity.  

Each program reflects a key aspect of C++ — from data structures and sorting algorithms to file management and simple console games.  
If you're learning C++ or simply enjoy the beauty of well-written foundational code, this collection will help you exercise and refine your C++ skills.

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains a wide variety of C++ programs, including:

- 🔤 **String manipulation** – Case conversion, string sorting, and repetition handling  
- 🔢 **Algorithms** – Binary search, selection sort, and point sorting  
- 🧮 **Calculators** – Basic and advanced versions (Calcolator and Calcolator Pro)  
- 🕹️ **Games and Simulations** – Snake, Four in a Row, and Mench (board-style logic)  
- 📂 **File handling** – Reading, writing, and managing data via file streams  
- 🧱 **Data structures** – Stack implementations and basic memory handling  
- 🧭 **SDL Graphics** – Simple projects using the SDL2 library for graphics-based logic

Every project folder includes its corresponding `.cpp` source file and, in some cases, compiled executables or supplementary data (like `map.txt` or `.pdf` explanations).

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
   cd <your-repo-name>
``

2. **Compile a program**
   Use any C++ compiler such as `g++`:

   ```bash
   g++ "Binary search.cpp" -o binary_search
   ./binary_search
   ```

3. **Run in an IDE**
   You can also open `.cpp` files in your preferred IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, dev c++, or CLion) and run them directly.

## 💡 Highlights

* All code written from scratch — focusing on **clarity**, **efficiency**, and **classic programming discipline**.
* Covers **core algorithms** and **data structure principles** every C++ developer should know.
* Some projects include **SDL-based graphics**, showing early steps toward graphical programming.
* A great resource to **learn, practice, or review** fundamental C++ coding.

## 🧭 Philosophy

> “Learn the old ways, master the new ones.”

This repository reflects my respect for **traditional programming** — understanding the fundamentals before relying on modern frameworks or shortcuts.
It’s a journey through logic, algorithms, and careful coding — the heart of what makes programming both an art and a science.

### 💬 Final Note

C++ isn’t just a language — it’s a discipline.
Master these programs, and you’ll have the foundations to build *anything* in software.
